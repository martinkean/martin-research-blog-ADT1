    Our research into UX design puts the user first, making accessible, modern
    websites that load fast, are secure, and are easy to use via multiple
    viewports and device widths.
description: Thinking like a designer can transform the way organizations
  develop products, services, processes, and strategy. This approach, which is
  known as design thinking, brings together what is desirable from a human point
  of view with what is technologically feasible and economically viable. It also
  allows people who aren't trained as designers to use creative tools to address
  a vast range of challenges. (https://designthinking.ideo.com/)

        variety of coffee beans grown with great care for the environment and

        We believe that good coffee has the power to bring people together.
        That’s why we decided to turn a corner of our shop into a cozy meeting
        space where you can hang out with fellow coffee lovers and learn about
        coffee making techniques. All of the artwork on display there is for
        sale. The full price you pay goes to the artist.

    Design thinking is a human-centered approach to innovation that draws from
    the designer’s toolkit to integrate the needs of people, the possibilities
    of technology, and the requirements for business success.

    We hold our coffee to the highest standards from the shrub to the cup.
    That’s why we’re meticulous and transparent about each step of the coffee’s
    journey. We personally visit each farm to make sure the conditions are
    optimal for the plants, farmers and the local environment.
