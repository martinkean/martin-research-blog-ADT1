## Online Style

Online writing is best presented using short segments of texts written in a clear, concise style and with ample use of editorial landmarks. This style supports the scanning style used by many web readers. But online prose does not have to be stripped down to a few headlines and bullet points to be effective: many readers will engage directly with longer written material online or print long articles to read offline.

## 
Contrast and emphasis

On the web, more than any other prose medium, the look of text layout strongly affects how readers relate to written content. The contrast produced by headlines, subheads, lists, and illustrations give users visual “entry points,” drawing their eyes down the page and into the content. Although the heading and list markup might look excessive in print form, on the web this markup has two big advantages:
Frequent headings and lists of items favour both scanning and methodical readers by adding visible structure to the online reading experience. Compared to large, high-resolution print pages, web pages usually lack the room to use the more subtle white space and typography of print publications.
The added structure of heading and list markup aids in search engine optimisation and online searches for content, because the additional markup provides explicit semantic emphasis, heading keywords, and context cues that listed items are strongly related to one another.
